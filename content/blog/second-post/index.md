## Heading of some kind

This is some text under a heading. We have the following topics to cover

- topic one
- topic two
- topic three

and so on and so forth.

### Subheading

Let's review some code.. how about some math $$x$$

```python
import numpy as np

class LMS:
    __init__(parameter):
        self.parameter = parameter
        self.indices  = np.arange(0, 1, 0.2)


```

OK, lets try some inline Latex $E = mc^2$

Now, lets try some non-inline Latex

$$
E_b = \frac{P_tT}{\log_2(1 + \textrm{SNR})}
$$
